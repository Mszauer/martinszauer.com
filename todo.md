About Me (towards bottom)
========
TLDR Version: Resume / CV

I'm driven by learning the "why" behind the "how". Natural curiosity drives me and programming allows me to satisfy these curiosities.

My formal education is in Business Management and Leadership, but during my senior year I found a deep passion for programming. I put a great focus on group dynamics and communication, what I consider  two of lifes most vital skills. Through software development I find joy in taking ideas from an idea to production, being able deliver a usable product to the stakeholders and brings value to the end users.

For everything else, you can reach me at dev@martinszauer.com
